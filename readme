This is a program to send messages using the UDP protocol while making sure that the
two way communication street is secure.

## How to run the program
1. Have two open terminals.
2. In the first terminal, compile the program using Javac main.java
3. In the first terminal, run the program using java main.java
    a. Enter the name of the text file you want to run
4. In the second terminal, run the program using java main.java
    a. Enter the name of the text file you want to run
5. Now the two terminals should be able to communicate with each other.

## How the program works
1. The program uses the UDP protocol to send messages between the two terminals.
2. The program uses a key to encrypt the messages before sending them.
3. The program uses a key to decrypt the messages after receiving them.
4. The P and G values are hardcoded into the program.
5. The program uses the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to generate the key.
6. In order for the program to send and receive, the program is multi-threaded.
7. The DHParameterGenerator is used to generate the P and G values.
